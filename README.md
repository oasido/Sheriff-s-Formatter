# Sheriff's Formatter

A website with a user & admin CP, created to be used as a formatting tool for an online game.

#### Please note:

I know how bad this project is built, please note that this is an extremely old project I started out just to see what I can develop in the long run, it went better than expected at the time, considering the lack of knowledge. Hence the almost nonexistent comments, order & repetitiveness.
But hey, it works!

#### Demo:
[Click here](http://formatter.ofekasido.xyz/) to check out the demo.

**Username:** `testuser`

**Password:** `password`

## Opening

Hello, I decided to make a small tool that was originally supposed to just simply easy the creation of forum reports. With the increasing amount of bad encounters we have on the server, considering the fact that any other report tool at the time was not available due to bad host/expiration of domain and the general discontinuation of all of the tools I could find, the tool was originally designed to simply fulfill one thing.

I found myself adding another form into the tool, and then tweaked the user interface, and added more and more forms into the tool. I eventually found myself going to the direction of reviving the [old tool made by W1nd0x and St3fan[NL]](https://sd.lsgov.io/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=73079).

Just like the old tool we had, it's your choice if you want to mess with BBCode or not. This tool was made to ease things up and make every forum based work an easier task.

Until not long ago, we had certain pages protected by a password. With the new update that brought in the ranks and user groups, it is no longer necessary.

## Explanation

The idea is simple, similar to this forum and the old tool, have user groups and ranks for each and every user created. This allows the tool to determine who is and who is not allowed to access pages.
Each and every user that has registered will be required to wait until he is approved by a Lieutenant+. Yes, I know, Lieutenant+ and moderators will have more work (forum work, aye) but until we have the majority of the people registering, the tedious work of verifying users will lower.


## What Is It Anyway?

A website that helps you generate forms with ease without messing with BBcode. You fill out the required information, press the 'Generate' button and post.

## Starting Out

1. First, enter this page [here](http://www.sheriff-format.com/register).
2.  Use this code on the register page: `PAA2IF5CJHJZ1ECW03J2`
3. Once registered, reply to this topic with this format, so we can verify it's you: `Registered with username: userNameExample`
(Last form you'll ever make? Probably not..)
4. Wait patiently or bug someone who can verify your account.

* Any Lieutenant+ will be able to verify users. **If you're a Lieutenant and you verify someone, quote his request on this topic so we know his request was handled.**
* There are user group leaders for each bureau, user group leaders are able to moderate their area (add/remove users).

## Requests

As of now I know the tool is still missing forms, if you are a leader of a certain group and want your forms to be automated in this tool, feel free to shoot me a message via Discord/PM.
